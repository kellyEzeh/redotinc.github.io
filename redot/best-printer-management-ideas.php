					<p>Why is it that when it comes to giving an advice, everyone seems to have an opinion? Colleagues, friends, staff, the gateman, and the guy cleaning up…everyone get a vote. Worse, the people writing the cheques or raising the LPO (decision makers) often listen to whoever the last person was who offered them advice.</p>
					
					<h3>A brief back-story on the best printer management ideas.</h3>
					<p>For example, an intelligent individual came to me recently with an idea he heard about printer management. This person had used our premium toners and understood the cost savings and business fundamentals. But this idea was strange and unsupported at best.</p>
					<p>I had to ask, “Where did you come up with that one?” It turns out that this left-field advice originated with someone they had just met in a restaurant. (A stranger in a restaurant!).</p>
					<p>Suffice to say, it was a bad idea… more like a hearsay guess presented as fact. But there was no evidence, no authority, and no proof. Yet a stranger was willing to risk someone else’s money on this unsupported notion.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Premium Toners: will it work just as well as OEMS? Is there any evidence?</h3>
					<p>When it comes to buying the right kind of compatible ink or toner for your printer, premium toners makes a huge difference.</p>
					<p>Premium products are carefully manufactured and tested in accordance to stringent procedures like the BSA (British Standard Alliance) and have ISO 9001/14001 certification. These toners work with All major OEM brands -- HP, Epson, Canon, Samsung, Olivetti, Xerox, Brother and franking Machine inkjet, without impairing the function or operation of the printers.</p>
					
					<h3>Expert Advice: why should you choose premium toners?</h3>
					<p><strong>Cost Saving without compromising the quality:</strong> For companies that go through a lot of document printing day in day out with their toner cartridge cost going to the roof, Our toners will provide substantial cost savings over OEM toners. Our toners can save you a whooping over 30% off buying OEMS without having any negative effect on your printer. Reliability: In Nigeria, most of the OEMs have been adulterated therefore making it difficult for the end users to buy quality. With Premium toners, you can be rest assured that you are buying quality because we have the exclusive right to sell these products in Nigeria. We can boast of business dealings with clients like: Guaranty Trust bank (GTB), Skye bank, Niger Insurance, Royal Exchange Insurance e.t.c</p>
					<p><strong>Product Quality:</strong> Our inkjets are developed in-house from the initial shell to the finalized packaged product. Our ink is sourced from formulab and all products are fully tested in accordance to stringent procedures. For our Revolutionary Toner range, all parts and majority of the toner powder are sourced and manufactured by Mitsubishi Japan. Our ink formula remains consistent with that of the original, and recent survey illustrated that 9/10 customers will choose ‘Radinks’ over OEM due to clarity, color depth and image sharpness.</p>
					<p><strong>After Sales Support:</strong> In the case of a genuine faulty batch, there is a ‘no quibble’ return policy in place to swiftly replace the goods through a well-documented return policy.</p>
					<h3>How much is Your Embarrassing Toner Costing You?</h3>
					<p>After working through a late night and early morning, you finish typing a report just ten minutes before the meeting starts. You hit print in time to grab a cup of coffee on the way…and the printer lets you down. You can see some of the words, but the whole document is faded and you’re about to be embarrassed in front of your entire team.
	There’s hardly anything worse than an unreliable toner and few things more frustrating than getting consistently badly printed documents.</p>
